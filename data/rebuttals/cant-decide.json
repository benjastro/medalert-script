We’ll send you out the system, we will pay for the shipping, use it and get used to having the device and then make a decision on whether or not you want to keep it.  But if you and your (son/daughter/husband/ kids) decide you don’t want to keep it, return it. This way you can use it and then make a decision TOGETHER with your (son/daughter/husband/ kids) on whether or not you want to keep the system. Now, let’s go ahead and get you signed up so you can make a decision together on whether you think the system is right for you. Remember, there is no long term contract.  So lets get you protected."
