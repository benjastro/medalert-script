These injuries can make it hard to get around or live independently, and increase the risk of early death. Falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injuries which account for approximately 46% of fatal falls among older adults. Most other fractures among older adults are also caused by falls. In 2008, 82% of fall deaths were among people 65 and older. So let's get you protected."
