            So (Customer) I’m just going to go over what you’re eligible to receive today with your medical alert package.
            <br><br>Now with this device if you have any kind of emergency whether it’s a medical emergency, fire, or even a simple fall that you have difficulty getting up from.  You just push the button on your waterproof necklace and speak to a certified emergency technician that will immediately get you the help you need. 
            <br><br>Your device works anywhere you take it with GPS to pinpoint your location whenever you have an emergency, as well as fall detection, so even if you're unable to push the alert button you're still going to get the help you need no matter what. So as you can see this device can definitely help you in time of need and even be life-saving.
            <br><br>So what you’re going to receive today is a waterproof necklace pendant, free shipping, free activation and even the equipment comes to you at no cost which is an over four hundred dollar value. But today you pay absolutely nothing for the equipment, the only thing you’d be responsible for TODAY is the emergency medical technician monthly monitoring of just fourty four ninty five also there is no contract or cancellation fee's whatsoever, so what address would you like your emergency medical alert system shipped to?
